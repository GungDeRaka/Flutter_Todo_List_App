# Flutter Simple Todo List App
## Just an ordinary Todo List App


Through this <strong>Todo List App</strong>, I try to implement the things i just learned in Flutter.

For example, I have studied how to use Provider State Management and Hive Local Database on Flutter.After that I tried to implement it in this App based on my understanding.
